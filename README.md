# rps-bot-pokemon

This was our mini-project that we did in class. 
While we were supposed to create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors machine, I wanted to make mine a little more fun. 
Since I've been wasting a lot of time recently playing Pokemon Shining Pearl, I decided to make a Pokemon themed RPS bot. 
Instead of having a counter for wins, I had an HP system instead with lots of dialogue options similar to the pokemon battles. 
Hope you have fun with this!
